# conference_nametags

This project merges entries in the conference signup sheet to additional user info in the forum database via the API. You must have the api_key file (not part of this project) in the same directory as main.py. 

1. Copy the first 5 columns of the signup sheet to a local copy
2. Some users will use different email addresses and won't match. Iteritively run main.py and hand-edit the local copy to resolve those cases.
3. It may be helpful to add checks in the local copy for patreons who are not members, etc.

Give the output to Olivier for the next step.
